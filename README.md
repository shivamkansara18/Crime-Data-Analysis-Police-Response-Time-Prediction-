# Crime Data Analysis & Police Response Time Prediction

This project focuses on analyzing crime data to identify patterns, trends, and high-risk zones, along with predicting police response times using machine learning. The goal is to support law enforcement in strategic resource allocation and proactive crime prevention.


### 1.  Objectives
Analyze and visualize historical crime data to identify hotspot areas, recurring trends, and victim patterns.

Predict crime types based on time, location, and other features using machine learning.

Estimate police response times using regression models to assist emergency planning.

Simulate data processing at a big data scale using HDFS for distributed storage.


### 2.  Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python

Visualization Libraries: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly

Database & Querying: PostgreSQL

Machine Learning: scikit-learn (Random Forest, Regression Models)

Big Data Tools: Hadoop HDFS

Data Format: CSV


### 3.  Key Features
 Hotspot Detection: Visual heatmaps and cluster analysis to identify high-crime zones.

 Trend Analysis: Time-based analysis to identify patterns across hours, days, and seasons.

 Crime Classification: ML models to predict crime types based on input features.

 Response Time Prediction: Regression model to estimate how long police might take to respond to a crime.
